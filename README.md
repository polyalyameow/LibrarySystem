# Library System

Final project for "Programming 1" - course.

The project consists of two parts:
1) The first part is a password-protected menu created for librarians to add new books, edit, delete, and list existing books.
2) The second part is created for visitors to get a library account, borrow and return books, and get a list of books that they have borrowed.
3) 
The project is written in Python 3 and uses OOPS concepts.
